# open-delivery

Door Dash clone, but open source and with "0" fees.

Instead of being a man in the middle everything works peer to peer.


## How we make money?

### Delivery Network

Small fees on the delivery
You'll still be able to deliver yourself for free as a restaurant

### Printing menus and other marketing materials

Small commission if you decide to order through us (we'll beat regular sources by scaling) 


### Online Payments

Free offline payment (cash or card)
Online payment will have a small fee at least until we find a peer to peer way

### Websites

AI and efficient code allows us to offer high quality websites with 0 effort (at least near 0)
And therefore allow every tiny restaurant to have a nice modern website.

### Advertizement

There will be spots where you can feature your appearance for money, but this will be kept to a minimum and we'll rely mostly on ratings and genre

### POS and ERP

Make a nice POS and connect to an open source ERP
Sell this product for cheap and make sure it fits most cases out of the box.
And setup is easy, e.g. scan products from image of a menu
